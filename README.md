# Predecting-Hotel-Rating

## Overview 

this project presents a comprehensive approach towards understanding and leveraging online hotel reviews to predict hotel ratings. It highlights the significant impact of digital platforms like Tripadvisor on consumer choices in the travel industry and addresses the challenge of analyzing qualitative data from customer reviews. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on a dataset of 20,000 Tripadvisor hotel reviews, the project aims to extract critical features such as sentiment, keywords, and thematic categories to reveal patterns that influence hotel ratings and customer satisfaction.

This project promises valuable insights for various stakeholders in the hospitality and travel sector, including hoteliers, online travel agencies, and travelers, by enhancing service offerings and making informed accommodation choices.
